This is an English Knowledge Base for SIML Projects. This knowledge base is updated frequently and should be used if you are planning to create a Standalone English Chatbot that does not depend on any external templates.

1. As with all SIML files the encoding used is UTF-8
2. This Base template is automatically included as a template option for XAGARD
3. You can use this knowledge base in any of your Project.
